## What is a cryptocurrency? 
#### Cryptocurrencies are [decentralised](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/decentralization) digital alternatives to conventional payment methods. Cryptocurrencies try to remove the need for [intermediaries](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intermediary) - such as banks - for transactions between two entities. [[1]] Transactions are stored in distributed ledgers, which typically uses the blockchain datastructure to validate data on the local and remote nodes. [[2]]
